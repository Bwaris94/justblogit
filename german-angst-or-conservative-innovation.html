</marker><p><strong><center><blockquote>“Disruptive ideas and innovations don’t work in Germany.”</blockquote></center></strong>   </p><p><strong><center><blockquote>“German investors need to see traction more than the idea before putting their money in. They aren’t that risky with their money.”</blockquote></center></strong></p><p>As a start-up founder in Munich, I simply cannot count the number of times I have heard and perhaps parroted these ideas almost as an undisputed fact. In fact, as a founding team, often we have explored the thought of moving to the Silicon Valley simply because as non-EU citizens, the barriers to us establishing a company and securing funding within Germany have been huge. Not to mention, the rather long-term investment in terms of resources that developer tools demand.<br>Similarly, Lennart, working with Microsoft, has heard clients in the IT sector often criticize Germans and German companies for a lack of innovation. Whilst companies in the US are often perceived as forerunners, German companies are perceived as lacking the initiative to try out new or “disruptive” things. Especially in the IT department of German companies the message of “inevitable innovation need” is perceived to often lack urgency. Therefore, processes are not only seen as a stereotypical German speciality but lead to the idea: ”Never Change a Running System” to be lived in Germany.</p><p>Some other examples of this perception are notable in the discussions regarding the 5G network expansion plans or in the recurrent and very often cited idea that the next Google or Apple will not originate here.
As one German investor Frank Thelen said:</p><p><strong><center><blockquote>“We are struggling with the awarding of the 5G networks, but even when comparing the old LTE technology, we are not even in the top 30 in a European comparison.”</blockquote></center></strong>  </p><p>While this might seem like a stereotype thrown around nonchalantly, the proliferation of this idea made it worthwhile for us to delve deeper into it and to check the narratives, we ourselves have built and how they reinforce this perception without giving due credit to the processes that perhaps lead to informed albeit slow innovation. 
We, therefore, first picked a suitable lens to explore this idea further. Due to the normative nature of this idea and the subsequent cultural context that it is embedded in, we found the lens of "Conservative Innovation" to be conducive to our purposes.</p><p>The lens of conservative innovation was put forth by <strong>Sebastian Pfotenhauer</strong><sup id="a1"><a href="#f1">1</a></sup> Professor at the Technical University Munich (TUM) School of Management and Munich Center for Technology in Society (MCTS). </p><p>In multiple congress contributions<sup id="a2"><a href="#f2">2</a></sup> he explained conservative innovation as an approach of:</p><p>“...<strong>preserving traditional socio-economic orders</strong> rather than disrupting them; to <strong>favor and safeguard political and economic incumbents</strong> rather than enable new entrants; and to <strong>act from a perceived position of strength</strong> or even saturation rather than decline or emergency. Moreover, Bavaria innovates <strong>ignoring or even rejecting integrative European techno-politics.</strong>”</p><p>This phenomenon can especially be seen in the manufacturing sector (Heavily based in the south of Germany) since they operate out of a <strong>position of strength</strong> as one of the bigger drivers of economic prosperity and carrying a lot of political and social leverage due to it's role in the economy. Since manufacturing takes precedence in the south of Germany, it could potentially also be the reason for slower adoption rates of new “innovative” technology such as Cloud Computing. Given these incumbents have a strong position nationally, they tend to also be more cautious of changing systems that may relate to new challenges cropping up. Naturally, cybersecurity becomes an important factor in their deliberation to adopt cloud technologies or migrate to the cloud. Those companies tend to be in the second adoption “wave”, after the technology has been adopted and tested in real world scenarios.</p><p><strong><center><img src="/justblogit/img/katapultbw.jpg" alt="economic performance" width="400"></center></strong></p><p><em>Title: States and federal states with lower economic performance than Baden-Württemberg</em><sup id="a3"><a href="#f3">3</a></sup></p><h1 id="so-where-is-germany-in-its-cloud-adoption-journey" class="heading-0-0-14"><span class="anchor-0-0-15" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>So where is Germany in its cloud adoption journey?</h1><p>Germany is 22% below the average of 26%, when it comes to the use of cloud computing services in Europe.<sup id="a4"><a href="#f4">4</a></sup></p><p>However, one of the biggest concerns parroted in the IT sector have been that of the slow speed of adoption, change and innovation. The concern is spruced by the fear that <strong>these companies might lose an important time</strong> in the worldwide market disruption battle. To quote <strong>C. William Pollard</strong><sup id="a5"><a href="#f5">5</a></sup> from his book <em>The Soul of the Firm</em>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>“Learning and innovation go hand in hand. The arrogance of success is to think that what you did yesterday will be sufficient for tomorrow.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>These discussions around the idea of innovation within the IT sector in Germany tend to equate values of progress to technical innovation. In customer meetings, from experience such discourses result in quite arduously negative conclusions about innovation within their organisation which is perceived to be lagging behind.</p><p><strong><center><blockquote>“We want to leverage infrastructure as code to decrease the time to market but our Head of IT is stuck in the 90s.”</blockquote></center></strong>  </p><p>Or my personal favorite that almost always comes up in migration projects with clients:</p><p><strong><center><blockquote>“Our internal compliance policy does not allow it…”</blockquote></center></strong><br> 
Taking these personal experiences of working within the adoption of Cloud technologies and building a Cloud based platform from scratch within Germany, we want to explore this view further. Combining these experiences, we argue that the idea of cautiousness can be beneficial and is much needed given the nature of cloud technologies that we are developing. In fact, we argue for “considered innovation”.</p><h1 id="but-you-must-innovate-faster" class="heading-0-0-14"><span class="anchor-0-0-15" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>But you must innovate faster!</h1><p>The perception that Germany is lagging behind in the field of technology and innovation especially when it comes to IT and Software, has turned from an ephemeral joke to a prevalent idea spanning across fields. The idea of innovation is almost equated unquestioningly to values of progress and visions of futuristic technologies and national dominance. The normative idea of innovation is rarely questioned. It has become an answer, a buzzword and almost a knee-jerk reaction to most policy issues.</p><marker><center>But it begs the question:</center>

</marker><p><strong><center><blockquote>What problem, if any, are we solving through technical innovation?</blockquote></center></strong>  </p><p>And continuing that path: Is technical innovation and the number of resources needed for it, <strong>ALWAYS</strong> the most optimal answer to issues faced by different stakeholders within society today?</p><p>Could it be that the German culture because of historical developments prioritises values of "stability" and "cautiousness" and exercises maybe a healthy amount of "scepticism" when it comes to new technologies?</p><h1 id="the-german-angst" class="heading-0-0-14"><span class="anchor-0-0-15" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>The German Angst</h1><p>One of the earliest references of the term “German Angst” or more precisely “West Germany: Moment of Angst” can be found on the frontpage of the TIME MAGAZIN published in 1981.</p><p>Within the context of the society at that time, it was used to describe not just a feeling but was in fact a reference to the political and socio-economic climate, that was reigning in the German society. Germans seemed to fear a lot of things, existential dread being one of them as well as the perpetual risk of a nuclear war during this time period. This is further reflected in the 80s as an era in a divided by the “Berlin Wall” Germany. It was the decade of 99 Luftballons (99 balloons), protests against the arms race, the decade of "Atomkraft? Nein Danke.", the LGBTQIA (back then more commonly referred to as homosexuals) community beginning to come out in the open congregating in bars and clubs as well as the breakout of the HIV infection and sexual educational campaigns in schools. Suffice it to say: it was a politically charged atmosphere and Germans rightfully so, feared new technologies like nuclear arms.</p><p><strong><center><img src="/justblogit/img/time_german_angst.jpg" alt="German Angst" width="400"></center></strong></p><p><em>Title: West Germany: Moment of Angst</em></p><p>This of course, very subjective idea of cautiousness being part of Germany’s cultural reputation, has its root in many norms, values, socio-economic and political events that have shaped the country after World War 2. Leveraging the lens of Conservative innovation, we argue that today, it is commonly used as a synonym for something that is <em>“typically German”</em> in the field of innovation by Germans themselves as well as others.</p><marker><center>Meaning, the behaviour of being:</center>

</marker><p><strong><center><blockquote>Cautious, scared and critical towards anything “new”</blockquote></center></strong>  </p><p>German Angst, therefore, seen in context and from a retrospective lens, seems like a legitimate reaction. We can however, trace elements of this feeling in the way that cloud technologies are currently perceived and subsequently adopted within the wider context of German innovation.</p><h1 id="the-doomsday-arguments-please-dont-be-dramatic" class="heading-0-0-14"><span class="anchor-0-0-15" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>The doomsday arguments: Please, don’t be dramatic!</h1><p>I cannot count the number of times I have heard the most exaggerated use-cases and arguments from various IT departments about data breaches that have either downrightly stopped migration to the cloud projects in several departments or simply made it complicated and burdensome to do so. As frustrating as it is to sometimes work in such projects and argue time and again for cloud adoption through reassuring customers or offering ways around their doomsday scenarios or sending feedback to product groups to cater to these challenges directly through products: it is nevertheless necessary.</p><p>Disregarding needs and people by calling them paranoid, laggards or archaic is neither productive nor does it help with diffusion of technologies. In fact, these are the exaggerated use-cases, we need to think about and create scenarios around to then drive technology directionally towards the scenario that is beneficial. Collingridge dilemma when it comes to consequences of certain technologies that become clear only after its diffusion and are difficult to mitigate by then can be dealt with through scenario building.</p><p>Whilst innovation and disruption are almost always considered <em>“cool”</em> and most people cannot wait to jump on the bandwagon because well FOMO (fear of missing out) it becomes imperative that we view technologies not simply as technical products but also as a product of our shared societal visions. We can then address questions of inclusivity, diversity, consider social risks of certain technologies and how we want to collectively move forward. Therefore, innovation for the sake of innovation mentality needs to change!</p><h2 id="privacy-and-security-zhee-deutsch-concerns" class="heading-0-0-14"><span class="anchor-0-0-15" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>Privacy and Security: Zhee Deutsch concerns!</h2><p>Let’s revisit some concerns cited by different clients which seemed (also to me in that moment) sort of ridiculous to assess whether in fact they can be attributed to unreasonable paranoia or if there is some legitimate ground behind them.</p><marker><center><blockquote>“We designed the IT systems for the production plant with high security in mind. So, these systems will never go in the cloud!"</blockquote></center>

</marker><marker><center><blockquote>“The usage of cloud is not yet finally approved, as we have to do a deep assessment and due diligence for each service that you offer.”</blockquote></center>

</marker><p>So, let’s dive a bit deeper into the technicalities of it and why adopting cloud technologies leads to the perception that there might be increased security risks to it. What technical key considerations do companies need for cyber security and to safely migrate to the cloud? And how do these result in the perception that the Cloud is not secure?</p><p><strong>Data Classification</strong></p><p>A proper data classification setup is key to ensure good security and risk management. An established data classification can help clarify and point to our security requirements, as well as support architectural decisions. In the process of classifying data, it’s very important to not overengineer the process, but rather concentrate on a communication strategy, that allows the engineers and architects to easily draw architectural and/or security conclusions for the classification.</p><p>Data classification allows you to determine and assign value to your organization's data and provides a common starting point for governance. The data classification process categorizes data by sensitivity and business impact in order to identify risks. When data is classified, you can manage it in ways that protect sensitive or important data from theft or loss.</p><p><strong>Identity and Access Management</strong></p><p>One of the key pillars of security is a modern and thorough Identity and Access Management concept. This allows companies to ensure that the <strong>right person</strong> at the <strong>right time</strong> can access the <strong>right resource</strong> in the <strong>right way</strong>. Creating and implementing this concept can take some time, but once established companies can rely on it, without the need of constantly changing it. Also, overengineering is a big trap that companies can fall into.</p><p>Rather than implementing a highly sophisticated Role Based Access Control (RABC) concept, that only the Identity Team understands, companies could think about possible ways on how to “pull the plug” instead. “Security by obscurity” has never helped.</p><p><strong>Transparency</strong></p><p>Complexity is an increasing problem within the IT departments but also across the whole company. This allows Shadow IT (Ungoverned / uncontrolled IT) to erupt quickly. Cloud Computing can help companies establishing transparency across their estate and therefore, enabling them to react when something is off. However, this needs to be configured and made a core priority otherwise the technical department and complexity of on-premise takes the lead.  E.g. Ask anybody in the IT department if they are happy with their current Active Directory design.</p><h2 id="where-it-didnt-work-out" class="heading-0-0-14"><span class="anchor-0-0-15" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>Where it didn't work out</h2><p>As you can probably guess from these broad key considerations: the cloud is complex! It is partly due to this that having a comprehensive understanding of where security breaches can occur requires consolidated effort on part of business units and centralised IT. It also means changing business processes to balance risks and control. Yes, there will be security breaches but how quickly and effectively they are dealt with is very much embedded in basic business processes. However, this complexity leads to the perception that the cloud is not secure but on-premise is.</p><p>This is why guiding clients and their pertaining IT departments to this idea of having a “pull the plug” mechanism in place is naturally daunting and reinforces the idea that this magical, intangible entity called the “cloud” is not entirely safe. This reinforces the idea that centralised IT departments already hold that it’s unsafe to migrate critical applications to the cloud. Combined with the fact that by making IT business processes more transparent, migrating to the cloud takes away some of the power of centralised departments, allows them to reliably oppose the migration.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the following examples of breaches and why they happened (notice how we did not use MS related examples but yes, they exist too):</p><ol><li><p>Capitol One used Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host some of their applications. Which can be considered quite innovative; especially in the financial sector. However, they had misconfigured certain parts, which allowed a hacker to gain entry. This resulted in personal data of 106 million customers in the US and Canada being exposed, who had applied for credit cards.<sup id="a6"><a href="#f6">6</a></sup></p></li><li><p>Another example happened just recently in 2020. A cloud related data breach occurred at the pharma giant Pfizer. A misconfiguration led to the exposure of the private medical data with some of the information dating back to October 2018; All thanks to a misconfigured Google Cloud Storage Bucket.<sup id="a7"><a href="#f7">7</a></sup></p></li></ol><p>In fact, a study<sup id="a8"><a href="#f8">8</a></sup> published in June 2020 conducted on Cloud security breaches showed that about 80% of companies hosting their infrastructure on the cloud have faced instances of security breach in the last 18 months and almost half of them reported 10 or more breaches. (IDC, 2020)</p><p>Some commonly cited reasons were “…security misconfiguration (67%), lack of adequate visibility into access settings and activities (64%) and identity and access management (IAM) permission errors (61%) were their top concerns associated with cloud production environments. Meanwhile, 80% reported they are unable to identify excessive access to sensitive data in IaaS/PaaS environments.” (IDC, 2020)</p><p>In light of these numbers, it becomes abundantly clear that security breach concerns are certainly not just resistance to new technologies, but it is actually quite commonplace for these breaches to occur. Is speed in migration projects always the best way to go about it? Clearly not. Misconfigurations, lack of transparency on software architecture and access management can be dealt with if we take the time and create complimentary business processes and units to facilitate this adoption.</p><p>This quote summarizes certain aspects of the dilemma brilliantly:</p><p><strong><center><blockquote>"If data is the new oil, data breaches should be treated like oil spills"<sup id="a9"><a href="#f9">9</a></sup></blockquote></center></strong></p><p>We need to pause a and engage with the technology not only from a technical perspective but also its business and socio-economic impact!</p><p>Questions like:</p><marker><center><blockquote>What are the potential futures that could arise if this technology was widely adopted?</blockquote></center>

Microsoft President Brad Smith puts it in his book <em>Tools and Weapons</em> like this:</p><p><strong><center><blockquote>"When your technology changes the world, you bear a responsibility to help address the world you have helped create!"<sup id="a10"><a href="#f10">10</a></sup></blockquote></center></strong></p><h1 id="well-thought-out-adoption-build-the-scenarios" class="heading-0-0-14"><span class="anchor-0-0-15" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>Well thought-out adoption: build the scenarios!</h1><p>When it comes to technology (Cloud Computing included) and the quick adoption of it, companies need a trustworthy partner and certified cloud provider on their side. German companies are still able to deliver innovative products, but the timeline might shift slightly more into the future.</p><p>These perceptions can be attributed to slower cloud adoption in Germany was compared to other countries however, it also meant that the processes and plans were well thought-out and hopefully robust. The stereotypical cautiousness within the German culture can be leveraged to be more mindful and more aware of how we adopt, encourage, or discourage the use of new technologies. Being cautious, a little scared and critical of anything new, might even help German companies to deliver better and more secure products in the future!</p><p>So next time your customer is being a pain in the neck about projected costs, data breaches or adding on to your work, take a pause and consider the most ridiculous fears they have. Is there a possibility that the scenario they are painting might come true? Even if the probability of it happening is ridiculously low: is it nevertheless a possibility? If yes, what is the scenario? What are the social and economic costs associated with that scenario?</p><p>Think about it: do we really need more products that do not put in the resources and time to consider how they will treat our personal or even financial data? Do we really need more products that impact different groups and communities disproportionately? Do we really want more products that exacerbate social tensions? Do we really want products that allow us and strengthen our biases? Do we really want products that impact the sanctity of human lives?</p><p>Does it mean we should not innovate? No, but it means that we innovate responsibly and inclusively. Is innovation always great? No, think military innovations, innovations in the arms industries, innovations in algorithms that reproduce and exacerbate biases?</p><p>Listen to nay-sayers. Consider. Build scenarios. And yes, innovate actively towards ideal scenarios.</p><p><strong>Transparency</strong>
